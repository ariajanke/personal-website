#My Common Utilities Library and Unit Testing

Through the course of working on C++ projects. I've found the need to have a personal utilities library. Since this library is used with many of my projects, I take testing much more seriously. In fact in this library I've defined my own testing suite.

## A Simple Test Case

Take a look at this code for instance. It 'mark' is a preprocessor that marks the source file's current location. This case tests the 'string_to_number_multibase' function.

```cpp
mark(suite).test([] {
    std::string samp = "-0x567.8";
    int out = 0;
    bool res = string_to_number_multibase(samp, out);
    // should round up!
    return ts::test(res && out == -0x568);
});
```
As a note on design, mark is defined in the very source file it is used. There exist this definition above:
```cpp
#define mark MACRO_MARK_POSITION_OF_CUL_TEST_SUITE
```
Which should hopefully mitigate problems with the preprocessor. Unfortunately `std::source_location` won't be usable until C++20 (where I'm sticking to C++17).

## Testing with a Context

With testing it maybe desirable to setup a common context between test cases. This can accomplished with my home brew testing suite also.

```cpp
// test 'collect_candidates' function
// Unit, a special type may only call one of lambdas passed to it 
// by 'start'. 'start' is only call the nth lambda passed to it 
// if set_context is on it's nth iteration.
// 
// set_context works by calling the provided lambda multiple 
// times, until it detects that unit has not called any lambda 
// passed to it by start.
//
// This design has a down side, there is one call which sets up 
// that whole context, but no unit test is ran! [I've a plan to 
// fix this later :)]
set_context(suite, [](TestSuite & suite, Unit & unit) {
    // average should be 2
    std::vector<Interval> col = {
        Interval{ 0  , 1 },
        Interval{ 0.5, 1 },
        Interval{ 1.5, 1 },
        Interval{ 2.5, 1 },
        Interval{ 3.0, 1 }
    };
    TestUniMap map;
    map.set_elements(col.begin(), col.end());
    // here I'm testing TestUniMap's 'collect_candidates' function
    // this function should collect all overlapping intervals with
    // a given Interval
    unit.start(mark(suite), [&] {
        return test(map.collect_candidates(Interval{ 1.5, 0.4 })
                    .size() == 3);
    });
    unit.start(mark(suite), [&] {
        return test(map.collect_candidates(Interval{ 2.2, 0.4 })
                    .size() == 3);
    });
    unit.start(mark(suite), [&] {
        // we get *all* elements, they are all 'candidates'
        return test(map.collect_candidates(Interval{ 1.8, 0.4 })
                    .size() == 5);
    });
    // Have to squish my code for dev to
});
```

## Testing at Compile Time

Sometimes testing is not all that straight forward and probably should not even be done at runtime. It is possible that the compiler can catch failing tests before a binary is even produced with a `static_assert`. For instance testing my Grid class, which is essentially just vector plus a width dimension.

In this test case I check if my 'make_sub_grid' function returns the correct type.
```cpp
Grid<int> p;
p.set_size(3, 3);
[[maybe_unused]] auto a = make_sub_grid(p);
static_assert(std::is_same_v<SubGrid<int>, decltype(a)>, "");
```

I'll admit that perhaps my testing habits aren't as good as they could be. My limited time and cognitive resources limit the extent of testing that I do, otherwise I may not be able to create as many things. It's balancing act, and hopefully one where I can develop a better sense of judgement on how much time and energy to spend on testing.

Thanks for reading!
As always I welcome feedback and constructive (non-toxic) critique.
